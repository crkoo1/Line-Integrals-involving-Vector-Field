# Line_Integrals_involving_Vector_Field
This project involves analyzing line integrals in vector fields, focusing on the path and work performed by the gravitational field on the Endurance spaceship as it navigates near a black hole. 
The code is structured into two main sections: an analysis of the spaceship's path and a detailed calculation of the work exerted by the gravitational field. 
It is supported by MATLAB code and visualizations.
